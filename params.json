A batch script is required, as opposed\r\nto an ArcGIS tool, because the rasters take a very long time to\r\ndisplay in Arc, and the processing takes several hours. This is not\r\na reasonable amount of time to wait for a tool, so a batch script\r\nis used instead.\r\n\r\nFurther details about the scope of the study in which this data\r\nprocessing serves can be found in `landslide_study.pdf`.\r\n\r\n#Usage\r\n\r\nMake sure you have set your python path to be the python executable that ArcGIS uses. The only python library you need to have installed\r\nis arcpy.\r\n\r\nNOTE: This script processes 65GB of data. Make sure you have this much\r\nhard drive space availible. Also, this tool will require about 5 hours\r\nof run time.\r\n\r\nYou may just run the tool with no args if you have the following paths for your input, intermediate, and output directories:\r\n\r\nINPUT:\r\n```\r\nD:/gis-prog-proj/input/\r\n```\r\n\r\nINTERMEDIATE:\r\n```\r\nD:/gis-prog-proj/intermediate/\r\n```\r\n\r\nOUTPUT:\r\n```\r\nD:/gis-prog-proj/output/\r\n```\r\n\r\nAll input rasters that will be processed should be in the input\r\ndirectory. The intermediate and output directories need to be empty.\r\n\r\nTo run the script, you execute main.py:\r\n```\r\npython main.py\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou may pipe the output of the tool to a log file as follows:\r\n```\r\npython main.py > log.txt\r\n```\r\n\r\nAlternatively, you can specify the input, intermediate, and output\r\ndirectories. This is useful if you are low on hard drive space. All\r\nthree folder paths must be specified.\r\n\r\n```\r\npython main.py <input-dir> <intermediate-dir> <output-dir>\r\n```\r\n\r\nNOTE: The intermediate directory requires the most space (42GB).\r\n\r\n\r\n#Outputs\r\n\r\nThe output rasters are in the `output` directory. The naming convention\r\nis somewhat cryptic, because the arcpy tool only allows a maximum of\r\n13 characters for file names.\r\n\r\nAll directories that begin with `rcls` are the reclassified rasters\r\nthat did not run through Zonal Statistiscs.\r\n\r\nAll directories that begin with `zsrcls` are reclassified rasters\r\nthat DID run through Zonal Statistics.\r\n\r\nThe after rcls is `asp`, `sl`, or `ndvi`. These are the types of\r\nrasters -- Aspect, Slope, and NDVI, respectively.\r\n\r\nThe final number defines the resolution of raster. `200` means\r\n\"200m x 200m\".\r\n\r\n\r\n#Contributors\r\n\r\nNicholas Hallahan - nick@theoutpost.io\r\n\r\nRubini Mahalingnam - santhans@onid.orst.edu\r\n\r\n#License\r\n\r\nGNU GPLv3 License http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_General_Public_License\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
